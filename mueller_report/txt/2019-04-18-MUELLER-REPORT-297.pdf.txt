McGahn 3/8/ 18 302, at 1-2; McGahn 12/ 14/ 17 302, at 10. Phone records show that the President
called McGahn in the afternoon on June 17, 2017, and they spoke for approximately 23 minute s.
SCR026_000196 (President ' s Daily Diary, 6/ 17/ 17) (reflecting call from the President to McGahn on

do not show another call between McGahn and the President that day. Although McGahn recalled receiving
multiple calls from the President on the same day, in light of the phone records he thought it was possible
that the first call instead occurred on June 14, 2017 , shortly after the press reported that the President was
under investigation for obstruction of justice. McGahn 2/28/ 19 302, at 1-3. While McGahn was not certain
