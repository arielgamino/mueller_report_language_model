have the White House Counsel contact DOJ leadership .370 The President said he would take that
step .371 The President then ~dded, "Because I have been very loyal to you , very loyal, we had that
thing , you know. " 372 In a televised interview that was taped early that afternoon , the President was
asked if it was too late for him to ask Corney to step down; the President responded , "No, it ' s not
too late , but you know, I have confid ence in him . We'll see what happens. You know , it's going
to be interesting ." 373 After the interview , Hicks told the President she thought the President ' s
comment about Corney should be removed from the broadcast of the interview , but the President
wanted to keep it in, which Hicks thought was unusual. 374
Later that day, the President told senior advisors , including McGahn and Priebus , that he
had reached out to Corney twice in recent weeks. 375 The President acknowledged that McGahn
would not approve of the outreach to Corney because McGahn had previously cautioned the
President that he should not talk to Corney directly to prevent any perception that the White House
was interfering with investigations. 376 The President told McGahn that Corney had indicated the
FBI could make a public statement that the President was not under investigation if the Department
of Justice approved that action. 377 After speaking with the President , McGahn followed up with
Boente to relay the President ' s understanding that the FBI could make a public announcement if
the Department of Justice cleared it. 378 McGahn recalled that Boente said Corney had told him
there was nothing obstructive about the calls from the President , but they made Corney
uncomfortable. 379 According to McGahn , Boente responded that he did not want to issue a
statement about the President not being under investigation because of the potential political
ramifications and did not want to order Corney to do it because that action could prompt the
