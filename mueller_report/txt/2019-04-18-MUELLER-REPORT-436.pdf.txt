Response to Question Ill , Parts (a) through (g)
Sometime in 201 S, Michael Cohen suggested to me the possibility of a Trump Organization project
in Moscow. As I recall, Mr. Cohen described this as a proposed project of a general type we have
done in the past in a variety of locations . l signed the non -binding Letter of Intent attached to your
questions as Exhibit B which required no equit y or expenditure on our end and was consistent with
our ongoing efforts to expand into significant market s around the world.
I had few conversations with Mr. Cohen on this subject. As I recall , they were brief , and they were
not memorable. I was not enthused about the proposal, and I do not recall any discussion of travel
to Russia in connection with it. I do not remember discussing it with anyone else at the Trump
Organization , although it is possible. I do not recall being aware at the time of any communications
between Mr . Cohen or Felix Sater and any Russian government official regarding the Letter of
Intent. In the course of preparing to respond to your questions , I have become aware that Mr.
Cohen sent an email regarding the Letter of Intent to " Mr. Peskov " at a general , public email
account , which should show there was no meaningful relationship with people in power in Russia.
I understand those documents already have been provided to you.
I vaguely remember press inquiries and media reporting during the campaign about whether the
Trump Organization had business dealings in Russia. I may have spoken with campaign staff or
Trump Organization employee s regarding responses to requests for information , but I have no
current recollection of any particular conversation , with whom l may have spoken , when , or the
substance of any conversation. As I recall , neither I nor the Trump Organization had any projects
or proposed projects in Russia during the campaign other than the Letter of Intent.
