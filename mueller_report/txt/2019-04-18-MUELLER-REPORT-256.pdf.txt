message to Flynn telling him the President felt bad for him and that he should stay strong. 267

Analysis
In analyzing the President's conduct related to the Flynn investigation,
evidence is relevant to the elements of obstruction of justice:

the following

a.
Obstructive act. According to Corney ' s account of his Febmary 14, 2017 meeting
in the Oval Office, the President told him, " I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go , to
letting Flynn go ... . I hope you can let this go." In analyzing whether these statements constitute
an obstructive act , a threshold question is whether Corney's account of the interaction is accurate ,
and , if so, whether the President's statements had the tendency to impede the administration of
justice by shutting down an inquiry that could result in a grand jury investigation and a criminal
charge.
After Corney's account of the President ' s request to "let[] Flynn go " became public, the
President publicly disputed several aspects of the story. The President told the New York Times
that he did not " shoo other people out of the room" when he talked to Corney and that he did not
remember having a one-on-one conversation with Comey. 268 The President also publicly denied
that he had asked Corney to "let[] Flynn go" or otherwise communicated that Corney should drop
the investigation ofFlynn. 269 In private, the President denied aspects of Corney ' s account to White
House advisors, but acknowledged to Priebu s that he brought Flynn up in the meeting with Corney
and stat ed that Flynn was a good guy. 270 Despite thos e denials , substantial evidence corroborates
Corney ' s account.

In a statement on May 16, 2017 , the White House said: "While the President has repeatedly
expressed his view that General Flynn is a decent man who served and protected our country, the President
has never asked Mr. Corney or anyone else to end any investigation, including any investigation involving
General Flynn. . . . This is not a truthful or accurate portrayal of the conversation between the President
and Mr. Corney." See Michael S. Schmidt, Camey Memorandum Says Trump Asked Him to End Flynn
