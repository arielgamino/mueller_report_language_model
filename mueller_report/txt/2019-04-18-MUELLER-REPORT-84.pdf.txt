(December 2015-June 2016)

i. Sater 's Overtures to Cohen to Travel to Russia
The late January comm_unication was neither the first nor the last time that Cohen

Organization , to travel to Russia to meet with Russian government officials and possible financing
partners. In December 2015 , Sater sent Cohen a number of emails about logistics for trav eling to
Russia for meetings. 358 On December 19, 2015 , Sater wrote:
Please call me I have Evgeney [Dvoskin] on the other line.[ 359 ] He needs a copy of your
and Donald's passports they need a scan of every page of the passports. Invitations &
Visas will be issued this week by VTB Bank to discuss financing for Trump Tower
Moscow . Politically neither Putins office nor Ministry of Foreign Affairs cannot issue

VTB Bank CEO Andre y Kostin , will be at all meetings with Putin so that it is a business
meeting not political. We will be invited to Russian consulate this week to receive invite
& have visa issued .360
