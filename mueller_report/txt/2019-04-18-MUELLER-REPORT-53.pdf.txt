[W]e want this repository to become "the place" to search for background on hillary 's
plotting at the state department during 2009-2013. . . . Firstly because its useful and will
annoy Hillary, but secondly because we want to be seen to be a resource/player in the US
election, because eit [sic] may en[]courage people to send us even more important leaks. 158
b. WikiLeaks's First Contact with Guccifer 2.0 and DCLeaks
Short ly after the GRU's first release of stolen documents through dcleaks.com in June
20 I 6, GRU officers also used the DCLeaks persona to contact WikiLeaks about possible
coordination in the future release of stolen emails. On June 14, 2016, @dcleaks _ sent a direct
message to @WikiLeaks , noting , "You announced your organization was preparing to publish
more Hillary's emails. We are ready to support you. We have some sensitive information too, in
particular, her financial documents. Let's do it to ether. What do ou think about ublishin our

a much higher impact than what you are doing." 160

messaging function, writing, " if you have anything hillary related we want it in the next tweo [sic]
days prefab le [sic] because the DNC is approaching and she will solidify bernie supporters behind
her after." The Guccifer 2.0 persona responded, "ok ... i see." WikiLeaks also explained, "we
think trump has only a 25% chance of winning against hillary ... so conflict between bernie and
hillary is interesting." 161

c. The GRU's Transfer of Stolen Materials to WikiLeaks
Both the GRU and WikiLeaks sought to hide their communications, which has limited the
