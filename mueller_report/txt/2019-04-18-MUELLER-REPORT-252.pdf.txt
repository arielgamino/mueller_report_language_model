had misled the Vice President. 236 The conversation turned to the topic of leaks of classified
information, but the President returned to Flynn, saying "he is a good guy and has been through a
lot."237 The President stated, "I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to Jetting Flynn
go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go."238 Corney agreed that Flynn "is a good guy,"
but did not commit to ending the investigation of Flynn. 239 Corney testified under oath that he
took the President's statement "as a direction" because of the President's position and the
circumstances of the one-on-one meeting .240
