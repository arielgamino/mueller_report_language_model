President's decision to terminate Corney was driven by the recommendations
received from Rosenstein and Sessions. 467

the President

In the morning on May 10, 2017, President Trump met with Russian Foreign Minister
Sergey Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in the Oval Office. 468 The media
subsequently reported that during the May l O meeting the President brought up his decision the
prior day to terminate Corney, telling Lavrov and Kislyak: "I just fired the head of the F.B.I. He
was crazy , a real nut job. I faced great pressure because of Russia . That ' s taken off. ... I'm not
under investigation." 46 9 The President never denied making those statements, and the White House
did not dispute the account, instead issuing a statement that said: "By grandstanding and
politicizing the investigation into Russia's actions, James Corney created unnecessary pressure on
our ability to engage and negotiate with Russia. The investigation would have always continued,
and obviously, the termination of Corney would not have ended it. Once again, the real story is
that our national security has been undermined by the leaking of private and highly classified
information." 470 Hicks said that when she told the President about the reports on his meeting with
Lavrov , he did not look concerned and said of Corney, "he is crazy." 471 When McGahn asked the
President about his comments to Lavrov, the President said it was good that Corney was fired
because that took the pressure off by making it clear that he was not under investigation so he
could get more work done. 472
That same morning, on May 10, 2017, the President called McCabe. 473 According to a
memorandum McCabe wrote following the call, the President asked McCabe to come over to the
White House to discuss whether the President should visit FBI headquarters and make a speech to
