questioned whether Democratic operatives had arranged the June 9 meeting to create the
appearance of improper connections between Russia and Trump family members. 719 Hicks was
upset about Corallo's public statement and called him that evening to say the President had not
approved the statement. 720
The next day, July 9, 2017 , Hicks and the President called Corallo together and the
President criticized Corallo for the statement he had released. 721 Corallo told the President the

the call with the President , Hicks responded that only a few people had access to it and said " it
will never get out." 724 Corallo took contemporaneous notes of the call that say: "Also mention

Times that had claimed the meeting "primarily" concerned "a program about the adoption of
Russian children. " 728 Over the next several days , the President 's personal counsel repeatedly and
