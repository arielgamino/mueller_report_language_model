3. Flynn Makes False Statements About his Communications
Incoming Administration Officials, the Media, and the FBI

with Kislyak to

On January 12, 2017, a Washington Post columnist reported that Flynn and Kislyak
communicated on the day the Obama Administration announced the Russia sanctions. 122 The
column questioned whether Flynn had said something to "undercut the U .S. sanctions" and
whether Flynn's communications had violated the letter or spirit of the Logan Act. 123
President-Elect Trump called Priebus after the story was published and expressed anger
about it. 124 Priebus recalled that the President-Elect asked , "What the hell is this all about?" 125
Priebus called Flynn and told him that the President-Elect was angry about the reporting on Flynn's
conversations with Kislyak. 126 Flynn recalled that he felt a lot of pressure because Priebus had
spoken to the "boss" and said Flynn needed to "kill the story." 127 Flynn directed McFarland to
call the Washington Post columnist and inform him that no discussion of sanctions had occurred. 128
McFarland recalled that Flynn said words to the effect of, "I want to kill the story." 129 McFarland
made the call as Flynn had requested although she knew she was providing false information, and
the Washington Post updated the column to reflect that a "Trump official" had denied that Flynn
and Kislyak discussed sanctions . 130
When Priebus and other incoming Administration
about the Washington Post column, Flynn maintained that
Kislyak .131 Flynn repeated that claim to Vice President-Elect
secretary Sean Spicer. 132 In subsequent media interviews
