In his opening remarks at the HPSCI hearing, which were drafted in consultation with the
Department of Justice, Corney stated that he had "been authorized by the Department of Justice to
confirm that the FBI, as part of [its] counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian
government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election and that includes investigating
the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian
government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia 's efforts .
As with any counterintelligence investigation, this will also include an assessment of whether any
crimes were committed." 313 Corney added that he would not comment further on what the FBI

classified - but he observed that he had "taken the extraordinary step in consultation with the

investigation during the campaign" or "under investigation now." 315 Corney declined to answer,
