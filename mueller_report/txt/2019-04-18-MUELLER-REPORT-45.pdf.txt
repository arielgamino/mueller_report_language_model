Military Unit 74455 is a related GRU unit with multiple departments that engaged in cyber
operations. Unit 74455 assisted in the release of documents stolen by Unit 26165 , the promotion
of those releases, and the publication of anti-Clinton content on social media accounts operated by
the GRU . Officers from Unit 74455 separately hacked computers belonging to state boards of
elections , secretaries of state, and U.S. companies that supplied software and other technology
related to the administration of U.S. elections. 114
Beginning in mid-March 2016, Unit 26165 had primary responsibility for hacking the
DCCC and DNC , as well as email accounts of individuals affiliated with the Clinton Campaign: 115

to these networks, indicating that the later DCCC and DNC intrusions were not crimes of
opportunity but rather the result of targeting . 116
GRU officers also sent hundreds of spearphishing emails to the work and personal email
accounts of Clinton Campaign employees and volunteers. Between March 10, 2016 and March
15, 2016, Unit 26165 appears to have sent approximately 90 spearphishing emails to email
accounts at hillaryclinton.com. Starting on March 15, 2016 , the GRU began targeting Google
email accounts used by Clinton Campaign employees, along with a smaller number of dnc .org
email accounts. 117
The GRU spearphishing operation enabled it to gain access to numerous email accounts of
Clinton Campaign employees and volunteers, including campaign chairman John Podesta , junior
volunteers assigned to the Clinton Campaign's advance team , informal Clinton Campaign
advisors , and a DNC employee. 118 GRU officers stole tens of thousands of emails from
spearphishing victims, including various Clinton Campaign-related communications.
